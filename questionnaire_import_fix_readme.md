# Questionnaire Import Functionality Fix

This document provides instructions for fixing the issues with the questionnaire import functionality in the Educational Assessment Platform.

## Issues Identified

1. **Save All Questions Issue**: When importing questions, you receive the message "No questions were imported. Please check your questions and try again."
2. **Blank Questionnaire**: The imported questionnaire appears in the dashboard, but without any questions.
3. **Non-functional Buttons**: The "Edit", "Add Question", and "Delete" buttons don't work when clicked.

## Root Causes

After analyzing the code, we've identified the following issues:

1. **Session Handling Problems**: The imported questions are stored in the session, but the session data isn't being properly saved or updated.
2. **JavaScript Event Binding Issues**: The event handlers for the Edit, Delete, and Add Question buttons aren't properly attached to the elements.
3. **Potential Database Schema Issues**: There might be issues with the database schema that prevent questions from being saved correctly.

## Fix Instructions

We've created a comprehensive fix script that addresses all these issues. Follow these steps to apply the fix:

1. Make sure your Flask application is stopped.
2. Run the fix script:
   ```
   python fix_questionnaire_import.py
   ```
3. Restart your Flask application.

## What the Fix Script Does

The `fix_questionnaire_import.py` script performs the following actions:

1. **Checks Database Structure**: Verifies that the database exists and has the correct schema for storing questions.
2. **Fixes Session Configuration**: Updates the Flask app configuration to ensure session data is properly saved and persisted.
3. **Fixes Quiz Import Module**: Ensures that session data is properly updated when questions are modified.
4. **Fixes JavaScript Event Handlers**: Replaces the event handlers in the review_imported_questions.html template with improved versions that use event delegation for better reliability.

## Alternative Manual Fix

If you prefer to fix the issues manually, you can:

1. **Fix Session Configuration**: Add the following to your app.py after the Flask app initialization:
   ```python
   # Configure session to ensure data persistence
   app.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'filesystem'
   app.config['SESSION_PERMANENT'] = True
   app.config['PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME'] = timedelta(hours=5)
   ```
   (Make sure to import timedelta from datetime)

2. **Fix Quiz Import Module**: Add `session.modified = True` after each line that modifies the session data in quiz_import.py.

3. **Fix JavaScript Event Handlers**: Replace the JavaScript in review_imported_questions.html with the version provided in fix_review_template.js.

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, test the questionnaire import functionality:

1. Log in as a teacher
2. Go to the dashboard and select "Import Questionnaire" from the dropdown menu
3. Upload a document with questions and proceed to the review page
4. Test the Edit, Delete, and Add Question buttons
5. Save the questions and verify they appear in the subject view

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues after applying the fix:

1. Check the Flask application logs for any error messages
2. Verify that the database file exists and is accessible
3. Try clearing the database using the clear_db_simple.py script and recreating it
4. Ensure that your browser has JavaScript enabled and is not blocking any scripts

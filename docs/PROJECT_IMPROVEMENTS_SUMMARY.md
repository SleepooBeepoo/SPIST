3. **Teacher Review Interface**
   - Created a dedicated interface for teachers to review pending submissions
   - Separated submissions by grading status (pending, graded, auto-graded)
   - Added bulk grading capabilities for efficiency

4. **Student Feedback Enhancements**
   - Added visibility controls for showing/hiding correct answers
   - Implemented detailed feedback mechanisms for each question
   - Created announcement integration for notifying students about graded submissions

## Password Management Improvements

### Overview

Password management is a critical security component of the platform. Several improvements were made to enhance security and compatibility across different environments.

### Improvements and Fixes

1. **Consistent Hashing Method**
   - Standardized on `pbkdf2:sha256` hashing method for all password operations
   - Ensured compatibility across different Python versions and environments
   - Added explicit method specification in `set_password` function

2. **Error Handling for Legacy Passwords**
   - Implemented robust error handling in `check_password` to handle unsupported hash types
   - Added graceful fallback for passwords hashed with deprecated methods
   - Prevented exceptions from breaking the authentication flow

3. **Password Reset Functionality**
   - Enhanced the password reset workflow for better user experience
   - Added validation to ensure password security requirements are met
   - Implemented proper transaction management for password changes

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Added null password check to prevent authentication errors
   - Improved error logging for password-related issues
   - Ensured proper exception handling throughout the authentication process

## UI Improvements

### Overview

The user interface is a critical component of the platform's usability. Several improvements were made to enhance the user experience, accessibility, and visual appeal.

### Improvements and Fixes

1. **Dashboard Enhancements**
   - Redesigned the teacher and student dashboards for better information hierarchy
   - Added quick access links to frequently used features
   - Implemented responsive design for mobile compatibility

2. **Quiz Taking Interface**
   - Improved the quiz taking interface with better navigation between questions
   - Added real-time timer display for timed assessments
   - Implemented auto-save functionality to prevent data loss

3. **Enrollment Management**
   - Enhanced the subject enrollment workflow for both teachers and students
   - Added CSV import functionality for bulk student enrollment
   - Improved enrollment status indicators and notifications

4. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Enhanced color contrast for better readability
   - Added keyboard navigation support
   - Improved form validation feedback
   - Ensured consistent error messaging throughout the application

## Testing Methodology

### Approach

A comprehensive testing approach was employed to ensure the reliability and functionality of the implemented improvements:

   - Used pytest for automated test execution
   - Implemented test fixtures for consistent testing environments

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Tested interactions between components (e.g., document import to quiz creation)
   - Verified database migrations and schema changes
   - Ensured proper transaction handling across operations

3. **User Acceptance Testing**

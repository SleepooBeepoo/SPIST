## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized to provide both high-level overviews and detailed technical information:

1. **System Architecture** - Describes the overall structure, components, and interactions
2. **Database Design** - Details the data model, relationships, and schema
3. **Key Features** - Explains the main functionality of the platform
4. **Implementation Details** - Provides technical implementation information
5. **User Instructions** - Guides for teachers and students

## Using This Documentation

- **For Developers**: Start with the Comprehensive Documentation and Technical Implementation Guide
- **For Database Administrators**: Focus on the Database Schema Documentation
- **For End Users**: Refer to the User Guide

## Maintenance

This documentation should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the platform. Ensure that all documentation remains consistent with the current implementation.
